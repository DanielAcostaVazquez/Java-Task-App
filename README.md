# Java-Task-App
A highschool project where I created an app where you can set tasks and track people for doing said tasks. The app can send emails to remind, ask for advancements, or inform of the deadline. This app was done using Java

This app was done as part of the Computer Science Internal assessment by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO).
